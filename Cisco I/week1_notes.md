The internet is a non-owned system of interconnected networks, through telephone wire, fiber optics, wireless transmissions and satalite links. 
There are different types of network connections:
|Type of network| its use|
|------|-------|
|Small home networks| for use in a home, few devices connected to each other and the internet.|
|SOHO, or small office, home office| allows both small scale offices and those at ones home to connect togeather and share centralized information|
|medium to large networks| typically used by schools and corporations for hundreds and maybe thousands of interconnected users|
|world wide networks| connects everybody on the network to one another, all over the globe.|

RFID tags can be used and are connected to the internet to allow tracking of packages and other goods.
Sensors and actuators are connected togeather to accomplish automated tasks, such as a sensor recognizing something needs watered and sending the signal to an acutator to water it.

There are three types of collected data, and convienently three ways data is transmitted.
|types of data| how it is collected|
|------|------|
|volenteered data| this is data that is given up by you for one reason or another, could be your location for food suggestion results.|
|observed data| this is data that is gleened by things you do, what you purchase and where.|
|inferred data| this is data that is analyzed from both sets of data and can include your credit score and your insurance rates.|

|types of data transmission| what is does|
|-----|----|
|electrical signals| data is transferred through copper wire through series of impulses to its destination, typically telephone poles|
|optical signals| light that is sent in pulses by converting them from electrical signals.|
|wireless signals| wifi connected devices such as smart home appliances or ir signals such as tv remotes|

bandwith and throughput is how fast data is being transmitted, bandwith is your maximum, measured in kbps, mbps, gbps, tbps, thousand, million, billion, trillion bits per second respectively. throughput is how fast the data transmission is truely going after taking into account delays and latency due to multiple connected devices on the network.
