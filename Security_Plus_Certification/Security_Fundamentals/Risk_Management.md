Risk management is the process of protecting against, identifying the cause of, identifying the issue itself, documenting the circumstance, and righting the wrongs the attack has cost.
Proper Risk management weighs the risk of an attack vs the time it would take to protect against that attack. If a company spends its time protecting against a larger attack that has a 10% chance of happening, vs a smaller attack that has a 90% chance of happening, it has wasted resources by the time the smaller attack happens when they could have prevented or at the very least lessened its effects to infintessimal levels.
