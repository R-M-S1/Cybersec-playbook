There are six phases of incident responce in the general world of Cybersecurity. These are Preperation, Detection and analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and Post-Incident activity. 
Preperation: To prepare for an attack, it is important to make sure you're able to defend from one and contain it. It is also important to identify common and new threats and determine their potential impact on the organizations system.
Detection and Analysis: In the unfortunate event of an attack on the system it is important to figure out what type of attack it is, where it came from, and what systems it has effected.
Containment: To contain a virus it is important to slow it down or stop it in its tracks, this can be achieved by disconnecting systems from the server and blocking access from IPs that are known to cause attacks.
Eradication: after the virus is stopped it must be eliminated. This can be done by use of antivirus software or by manually removing the virus itself.
Recovery: After the virus has been eradicated it is okay to put things back to the way they were pre-attack, restoring backup data if need be, re-enabling disabled accounts, and potentially rebuilding infected systems. 
Post-Incident activity: This is the stage in which you should find where the incident originated from, how to prevent this from happening again, and improving security measures.
