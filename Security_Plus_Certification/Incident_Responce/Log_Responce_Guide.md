The two most common types of log formats are CSVs and JSon, CSVs are common seperated values and do exactly what they say, each value provided in a log is seperated by a common and each new instance is seperated by a linebreak. JSon is different as it has words next to the values so you more or less don't have to already know what each value means.
For CSV it is possible to use commands or different programs to help in decyphering what each comma seperated data block means.
