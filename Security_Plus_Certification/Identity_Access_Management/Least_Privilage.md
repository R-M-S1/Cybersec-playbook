# RBAC, Role-Based Access Control, is the process of restricting access to users in a sort of hierarchy style of privacy. Say there is a door that requires level three security clearence, and you have level two. You cannot get into that door without someone with authorization letting you in. Same with computer systems, if you do not have clearence to download apps or change settings, you cannot. Maybe you can change certain settings or download spesific apps. 
# DAC, Discretionary Access Control, is the form of privilage restricting access to information by groups or by affilation to groups, for instance, certain commands and permissions may only be givin to admins, admin permissions, and not to new hires.
# Mandatory Access Control, MAC, exists as a sort of copyright feature. Those that make information do not dictate who has the clearence to see that information. For example if someone finds a major flaw in the security of a company and creates a document on it, they do not have the permission to allow anybody to view it, it would be at the discretion of whoever does grant those permissons.
# Zero Trust is the securtity paradim of nobody is to have access to any information, weather that is inside or outside of the network. Assume everyone is untrustworthy and that information can be breached at any moment.
