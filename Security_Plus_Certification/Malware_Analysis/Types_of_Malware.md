Computer viruses are the most common type of malware for the common man, it aims to replicate itself by corrupting existing code on a computer, similarly to how viruses work in our bodies. It aims to make the device easier to steal data from. 
A worm is another common malware that does almost the same thing as a virus, except it replicates itself and infects other computers. The worm does not need a human to interact with it in order for it to replicate and infect other machines.
A Trojan, or Trojan Horse virus, aims to sieze not just your data but complete control over your machine. It often imbeds itself into a harmless looking download (the horse) and appears after you have already installed it. This can be mitigated for the most part by having your computer scan downloads for malicious code.
