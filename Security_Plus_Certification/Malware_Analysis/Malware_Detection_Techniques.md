Most computers come with self diagnosing software, they are both effective and free with every device. In the case of Windows defender you can schedule it to run in increments to periodically scan your device and ensure there is no viruses. There is also paid viral scanners but the free one also works perfectly fine. 
Along with the ability to scan your device, windows can also be set up to scan downloads as they are being installed for malicious code. Again, there are paid versions of the same free thing, but the free one works perfectly fine.
