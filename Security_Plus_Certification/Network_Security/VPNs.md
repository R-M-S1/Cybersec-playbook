VPNs, Virtual Private Networks, essentially mask your Network traffic, scramble it, sometimes to a different country of origin, masking your ip, and making it more difficult for companies to track your network usage by rerouting your traffic through a remote server. 

NordVPN is the most popular example of a VPN.
