IDS, Intrusion detection systems, and IPS, Intrusion prevention systems, work in tandem with each other. One detects a possible intrusion, the other prevents it from happening. However, IPS can, of course, detect intrusions on its own, making IPS more effective in preventing intrusions. 

Despite this, most companies utilize both IPS and IDS regardless as they both can synergize with each other and provide an extra layer of detection for attacks. 

IDS comes in two variations, Host and Network Intrusion Detection systems, whereas IPS uses an Anomoly based system to identify threats.
