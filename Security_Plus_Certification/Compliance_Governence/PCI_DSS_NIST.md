PCI DSS, or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, is the frame work for, as said in the name, data security protections involving payment cards. To be more spesific, the framework provides Payment card industries with a myriad of tools and resources to help protect card information and store it in a secure enviroment. There are twelve steps that card industries should follow but it summerizes into: secure consumer data, encrypt their transactions, update software when needed, use and maintain a firewall, and document any abnormalities in the aformentioned requirements.

The government agency NIST, or the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is the most common provider of cybersecurity compliance frameworks there is. It is responsible for the creation of several risk management frameworks including CSF, ERM, RMF, C-SCRM, and the NICE framework. CSF, or Cybersecurity Framework, is particularly notable as the bare bones of volentary guidelines, it allows organizations to become familiarized with how to successfully conduct CyberSecurity operations on a large scale.
